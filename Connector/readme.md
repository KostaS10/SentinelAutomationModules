# STAT Custom Logic Apps Connector

> [!WARNING]
> STAT v2 is now available in the main branch, all future deployments should use v2.  However, v1 can still be updated through this branch of the repository.

This custom connector for logic apps will link the STAT modules together to provide an easy to use interface to call each module and handle the returned results.
